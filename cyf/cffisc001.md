# Summary 

Improper handling of deleting array elements with `_beneficiary` arrayÂ 

# Vulnerability Details

```solidity 
function removeBeneficiary(address _beneficiary) external onlyOwner {
        uint256 indexToRemove = _getBeneficiaryIndex(_beneficiary);
        delete beneficiaries[indexToRemove];
    }
```

* Line 3 - The delete function will just 0 out that element in the array. Meaning there will be a hole in the array with a 0 address. Refer -Â [https://blog.finxter.com/how-to-delete-an-element-from-an-array-in-solidity/Â .](https://blog.finxter.com/how-to-delete-an-element-from-an-array-in-solidity/)
* Subsequent operations on the \`beneficiary\` array will lead to errors

# Impact

Functions that use this array will lead to errorsÂ  such as the -

```solidity 
 function withdrawInheritedFunds(address _asset) external {
        if (!isInherited) {
            revert NotYetInherited();
        }
```

and this function 

```solidity 
 function buyOutEstateNFT(uint256 _nftID) external onlyBeneficiaryWithIsInherited {{
   .....
 }
```
# Recommendations

Proper handling of removing elements from the array
